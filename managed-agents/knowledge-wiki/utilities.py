"""Shared helpers for the knowledge-wiki cookbook notebook.

Two functions the notebook imports:

- `poll_until_end_turn` drives a Managed Agents session by polling
  `events.list` (rather than holding one long SSE stream) until the
  turn ends, printing agent text and file-write progress as it goes.
  Polling makes each request short and independently retryable, which
  matters for the long extraction turns this cookbook runs.

- `wait_for_idle_status` absorbs the small race between the SSE
  `session.status_idle` event and the server-side status field, so an
  `archive()` call issued right after a turn doesn't 400.

    The `session.status_idle` event in the SSE stream can arrive
    slightly before `sessions.retrieve` reports `status == "idle"`,
    which causes an `archive()` call issued immediately after the
    stream exits to 400 with "cannot be archived while its status
    is running." This helper absorbs that race with a short poll.
    Call it after breaking out of a stream/poll loop and before

    """Poll a session's events until the turn ends, printing agent text.

    Streaming a long extraction turn over one connection is fragile —
    proxies reset long-lived streams. Polling `events.list` makes every
    request short and independently retryable, so a network blip costs one
    poll instead of the turn. Sessions can also be RESCHEDULED server-side
    mid-turn (you'll see session.error / session.status_rescheduled events);
    the work still completes — keep polling, which is why the default
    timeout is generous. Prints `agent.message` text and marks tool use.

    Returns the turn outcome: "end_turn" on success, or the stop reason if
    the turn ended abnormally (e.g. repeated server errors) — callers can
    re-send the message to the same session to retry the turn. Pass `sink`
    to collect the agent's message text instead of printing it — useful
    when the reply is markdown you want to render properly. Pass `stats`
    (a dict) to collect token usage and the turn's `reads_searches` count
    — every tool call that inspected the store rather than writing to it,
    so reads *and* searches, not reads alone.
