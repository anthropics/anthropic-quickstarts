# Managed Agents quickstarts

Projects built on [Claude Managed Agents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview): agents Anthropic runs for you, with server-side sessions, sandboxed tools, and an event stream your app consumes. Each quickstart is a complete, runnable app that pairs Managed Agents with a real product surface.

## Quickstarts

- **[chat-sdk/](chat-sdk/)** puts a research analyst in a
  browser chat with Vercel's Chat SDK. Each conversation is one
  persistent session (the conversation ID is the session ID); the
  analyst researches with web search and streams the final brief
  token by token over the same held response (session `event_deltas`
  previews) while a live feed shows the tool calls. No third-party
  credentials, and the same handler moves to Slack, Teams, Discord,
  Telegram, or WhatsApp by swapping the adapter.

- **[copilot-kit-ag-ui/](copilot-kit-ag-ui/)** puts a personal
  finance assistant in a CopilotKit chat over the AG-UI protocol.
  The upstream [`@ag-ui/claude-managed-agents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ag-ui/claude-managed-agents)
  adapter maps each chat thread to a managed session and streams
  replies token by token. When the agent wants to show numbers it
  calls custom tools that render as interactive charts (payoff
  timelines, growth projections, budgets) inline in the
  conversation, with sliders that recompute client-side.

- **[knowledge-wiki/](knowledge-wiki/)** distills a document corpus
  once into a knowledge wiki (a versioned memory store) using
  parallel extraction sessions, a resolve pass, and a steered
  consolidation dream (research-preview `client.beta.dreams`), then
  answers repeated analyst questions from the wiki instead of
  re-reading documents — with `[source | as-of]` provenance on every
  fact and a fraction of the per-question token cost. The worked
  example is a real M&A data room: the 2024 Squarespace / Permira
  take-private, fetched from public SEC EDGAR filings.
