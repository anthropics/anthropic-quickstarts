"""Container entrypoint: run one already-claimed work item to completion.

`EnvironmentWorker.handle_item()` does the whole per-session lifecycle:
memory-store download to each store's `mount_path`, tool dispatch against
the session's event stream, memory sync (a reconcile with the store every
`memory_sync_interval`, default 30s, checked after each tool call, plus a
final one at a clean end and a bounded push-only flush on any exit), the
work-item lease heartbeat, and the force-stop on exit. The file tools are
confined to /workspace plus the memory mounts, and a store attached
read-only refuses writes.

The only credential in this container is the per-session token carried
inside `ANTHROPIC_WORK_SECRET`. The environment key never enters a
container: the agent in here runs arbitrary bash, and a leaked environment
key could claim other sessions' work items. The sessions token is scoped to
this one session, and it is also the only credential the memory endpoints
accept.

Env (set by on-work.sh via `docker run -e`):
  ANTHROPIC_WORK_ID, ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID, ANTHROPIC_SESSION_ID
  ANTHROPIC_WORK_SECRET  - the work item's secret payload (base64url JSON
                           carrying `sessions_token`)
  ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL     - optional, default https://api.anthropic.com
