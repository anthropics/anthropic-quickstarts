# assistant-ui × Claude Managed Agents

A spreadsheet analyst in a chat window. [assistant-ui](https://www.assistant-ui.com/) is the whole frontend: the composer, the thread, the sidebar, the tool cards. One [Managed Agent](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview) session per conversation is the whole backend: it holds the transcript, runs `bash` with pandas in a sandbox, and streams every step back as events. Drop in a CSV, ask a question, and approve each shell command inline before it runs.

The only credential is Anthropic auth. `npm run dev`, open `localhost:3000`, and drag `sample_data/sales.csv` into the chat.

## Why this pairing

An agent app has two halves that never get built at the same time. The chat UI wants a message array to render and callbacks to fire: assistant-ui gives you the primitives (composer, thread, tool cards, an approval gate) and asks you to bring the runtime. The agent wants a durable place to think, a sandbox to run code, and a loop that survives your tab closing: Managed Agents gives you the session and asks you to bring the surface. Each ships the half the other doesn't.

The join is one file. [`lib/managed-agents/reducer.ts`](lib/managed-agents/reducer.ts) is a pure function from a session's event log to assistant-ui's message model, and the same function runs over stored history and the live stream, so an old chat and a running one can never render differently. assistant-ui's `useExternalStoreRuntime` takes the folded array; its `useRemoteThreadListRuntime` takes the session list as the sidebar. There is no database anywhere in the app, because sessions already are one.

The event log carries more than text, and this is where assistant-ui earns its place. A `web_search` result is a structured list of sources, so it renders as source cards. An `edit` is an `old_string`/`new_string` pair, so it renders as a diff. And an `always_ask` tool call is a session that has *stopped and is waiting for a click*, which is exactly what assistant-ui's approval gate is for.

## Sessions are the thread list

Most chat apps grow a conversations table on day two. This one asks the Managed Agents API instead:

- **The sidebar** is a `RemoteThreadListAdapter` ([`session-list-adapter.ts`](lib/managed-agents/session-list-adapter.ts)) over `client.beta.sessions.list()`, filtered to sessions this quickstart created (a `metadata` tag). Thread id and session id are the same string.
- **New chat** calls `sessions.create()` from the adapter's `initialize()`, which assistant-ui invokes on the first message. The first message then retitles the session server-side, so the sidebar and the Anthropic Console show the same name.
- **Opening an old chat** replays `sessions.events.list()` through the reducer. Tool calls, approvals, denials, the chart: all rebuilt from the log, so nothing can be stale. Kill the server, restart, reload: every conversation comes back, because none of it ever lived here.
- **Archive and delete** are the sidebar's dropdown, mapped onto `sessions.archive()` and `sessions.delete()`.

Because a session id arrives from the browser and becomes an API path parameter, every route under `/api/sessions/[id]` first passes it through [`ownedSession()`](lib/owned-session.ts): the id must parse, resolve, belong to this quickstart's agent, carry our metadata tag, and not be archived. Files never exist outside a session either: uploads post to `/api/sessions/[id]/files` and downloads check the file id against that session's own file set before a byte moves. The server key can see the whole workspace; the gate is what keeps a guessed id from reading it.

## The approval gate

The agent's toolset sets `bash` to `permission_policy: always_ask` ([`setup/agent-config.ts`](setup/agent-config.ts)). When the analyst reaches for the shell, the session doesn't run the command. It emits the `agent.tool_use`, then parks:

```
session.status_idle { stop_reason: { type: "requires_action", event_ids: ["sevt_..."] } }
```

The reducer stamps `approval: { id }` onto that tool-call part and sets the message status to `requires-action`, which is all assistant-ui needs to render the gate. The terminal card shows the exact command with Allow and Deny under it; Deny takes an optional note. The click becomes:

```json
{ "type": "user.tool_confirmation", "tool_use_id": "sevt_...", "result": "deny",
  "deny_message": "Not on this box." }
```

The `tool_use_id` is the *event* id of the tool-use, and confirmations are batched into one send (two clicks in the same beat ride together, because racing sends can be rejected mid-resume). A denial reaches the agent as the tool's result, so it adjusts instead of retrying. Reload with the gate open and the buttons come back exactly where they were: the pending request is in the log, not in browser state.

Match the policy to the surface. `always_ask` belongs here because there is a human at a keyboard to answer it; a scheduled or headless deployment wants `always_allow` (or bash off), or the session parks forever waiting for a click that never comes.

## Token streaming and reasoning

The tail opens with `event_deltas: ["agent.message", "agent.thinking"]`. As the model writes, the session sends `event_start`, then `event_delta` text fragments, then the buffered `agent.message` that was always there; the reducer folds the fragments into the text part and reconciles when the buffered event lands (a preview is always a verbatim prefix of its final message). Previews are best-effort and never persisted, so an org without the streaming gate gets the same code path with replies arriving whole.

`agent.thinking` is a progress signal with no reasoning text in the current API, so it renders as an empty reasoning part: assistant-ui's chain-of-thought group shows "thinking" activity without the app inventing content. Don't promise streamed reasoning text; the API doesn't send it.

## Tool cards

Every tool the analyst can call has a card, registered as a render-only assistant-ui toolkit in [`components/tool-uis/`](components/tool-uis/) (no client `execute`, no build plugin):

| Tool | Card |
|---|---|
| `bash` | terminal: `$ command`, the approval gate, then stdout (error output in red) |
| `web_search` | the query as a chip, `search_result` blocks as source cards |
| `web_fetch` | the URL, then a preview of what came back |
| `read` / `write` / `glob` / `grep` | path or pattern, with collapsible output |
| `edit` | `old_string` → `new_string` as a unified diff (assistant-ui's `DiffViewer`) |
| `show_chart` | a custom, client-executed tool: an inline SVG chart |
| anything else | `ToolFallback` (MCP tools, other custom tools) |

`show_chart` is the one *custom* tool. Managed Agents doesn't run it: the session parks on it, the card draws the chart from the tool's input, and the session controller answers with a `user.custom_tool_result` ("Rendered to the user in the chat.") so the agent continues. Custom tools take a *result*, never a confirmation; sending `user.tool_confirmation` for one is a 400.

## Attachments become session files

Dropping a CSV on the composer runs the attachment adapter ([`attachments.ts`](lib/managed-agents/attachments.ts)): it awaits `initialize()` so a session exists, uploads to the Files API, and mounts the file read-only into the sandbox (`sessions.resources.add`, landing under `/mnt/session/uploads/`), all before the message is sent. The message just tells the analyst where the file is, and the mounted file shows as a chip on the thread.

Deliverables the analyst writes to `/mnt/session/outputs/` are meant to come back through `files.list({ scope_id })` as download chips. That query parameter is newer than the rest of the API and is not enabled on every organization yet; where it isn't, the call returns `400 unknown field scope_id`, [`session-files.ts`](lib/managed-agents/session-files.ts) catches it, and you get the upload chips without the download chips. The route and the membership check are written to the documented shape, so the chips light up the day the parameter reaches your org.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd managed-agents/assistant-ui
npm install
claude
```

Then ask: **"walk me through setting this up."** Claude reads [`skill.md`](./skill.md) and drives the whole thing. Or by hand:

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or `ant auth login` once and leave it out
npm run setup             # one-time: one agent + one environment; paste the printed IDs into .env
npm run dev               # open http://localhost:3000, drop in sample_data/sales.csv
```

Try: *"Summarize this file, then chart revenue by month."* You'll see a file card, a search or two if you ask it to cross-check, an Allow/Deny gate on every `bash` command, and a chart card.

Token previews (`event_deltas`) are part of the 2026-07-01 Managed Agents update and are gated per organization. Without the streaming gate everything still works and replies arrive whole instead of streaming.
