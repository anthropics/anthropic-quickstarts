## Logic vs Consensus Priority

### Current Implementation (Consensus-Heavy)

```python
# Equal weight to all layers
consensus_score = sum(layer_scores) / num_layers

# Problem: Non-logical layers dilute reasoning
```

### Improved Implementation (Logic-Prioritized)

```python
# Weight reasoning layers higher
logic_layers = [2, 3, 4]  # In 4x architecture
logic_weight = 0.75  # 75% weight to logic

logic_score = sum(layer_scores[i] for i in logic_layers) / len(logic_layers)
other_score = sum(layer_scores[i] for i in non_logic_layers) / len(non_logic_layers)

final_score = (logic_score * logic_weight) + (other_score * (1 - logic_weight))
```

### Logic Priority by Architecture

| Architecture | Logic Layers | Logic Weight | Consensus Impact |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| 4x | 2 (50%) | 60% | Moderate |
| 8x ✅ | 4 (50%) | 75% | Low |
| 16x | 8 (50%) | 82% | Minimal |
| 32x | 16 (50%) | 88% | Negligible |

**Key Insight:** More layers = higher logic proportion = better logical reasoning

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Start with 8x

```python
# Optimal for most use cases
tool = ExtendedThinkingTool(
    layers=8,
    logic_weight=0.75,  # Prioritize reasoning
    verbose=False
)
```

### 2. Add Dynamic Scaling

```python
# Adjust based on question complexity
complexity = estimate_complexity(query)

if complexity <= 2:
    layers = 4   # Fast path
elif complexity <= 4:
    layers = 8   # Standard path (most queries)
else:
    layers = 16  # Complex path
```

### 3. Implement Logic Prioritization

```python
# Weight reasoning layers higher
logic_layer_indices = [2, 3, 4, 5]  # For 8x
logic_weight = 0.75

# Calculate weighted consensus
final_score = calculate_weighted_consensus(
    scores=layer_scores,
    logic_indices=logic_layer_indices,
    logic_weight=logic_weight
)
```

### 4. Enable Contradiction Detection

```python
# Logic layers can veto consensus
if detect_logical_contradiction(logic_layers):
    # Reasoning layers override other layers
    final_answer = logic_majority_vote()
else:
    # Normal weighted consensus
    final_answer = weighted_consensus()
```
