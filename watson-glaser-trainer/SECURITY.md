## Security Model

The Watson Glaser Test Intelligence System (TIS) is designed with security and privacy in mind:

### Client-Side Only

- **No Server Communication**: All processing happens in the browser
- **No Data Transmission**: No data is sent to any external servers
- **No API Keys**: No authentication or external services required
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, telemetry, or user tracking

### Data Storage

- **LocalStorage Only**: All data stored locally on user's device
- **User Control**: Users can clear data at any time via browser settings
- **No Persistence**: Data is never persisted outside the user's browser
- **No Cookies**: No cookies are set or used

### Privacy Guarantees

✅ **No personal information collected**  
✅ **No usage tracking**  
✅ **No third-party services**  
✅ **No network requests**  
✅ **Complete offline capability**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### What to Report

- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities
- Code injection possibilities
- LocalStorage data leakage
- Browser compatibility security issues
- Any other security concerns

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com]
2. **Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] Watson Glaser TIS - [Brief Description]`
3. **Include**:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Within 7 days
3. **Fix Timeline**: 
   - Critical: 24-48 hours
   - High: 7 days
   - Medium: 30 days
   - Low: Next release cycle
4. **Disclosure**: 
   - Coordinated disclosure after fix
   - Credit to reporter (if desired)
   - Security advisory published

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Browser Updated**: Use latest browser version
- **Clear Data**: Periodically clear localStorage if sharing device
- **Trusted Environment**: Use on trusted devices only
- **No Sensitive Data**: Don't input sensitive information

### For Contributors

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape user-generated content
- **No eval()**: Never use eval() or Function() with user input
- **Content Security**: Follow CSP best practices
- **Dependencies**: Keep test dependencies updated

## Known Limitations

### Browser Security

- **LocalStorage Access**: Can be accessed by other scripts on same origin
- **Browser Extensions**: Extensions may have access to page data
- **Developer Tools**: Users with dev tools can inspect and modify data

### Mitigations

- No sensitive data should be stored
- All data is non-critical (learning progress only)
- Users can clear data at any time
- No authentication or authorization needed

## Security Checklist

- **CSP**: Content Security Policy implemented
- **Privacy**: No data collection, GDPR compliant by design

### Audits

- Last security audit: [Date]
- Next planned audit: [Date]
