## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-03

### Added

#### Core Features
- Extended Thinking architecture with 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x layer configurations
- Logic prioritization system (75% weight to reasoning layers)
- Neural evolution with self-modifying parameters
- Curriculum learning with progressive difficulty gating
- Meta-learning with adaptive strategy weights
- LocalStorage persistence for auto-saving progress

#### Question Types

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- 8x layer default configuration
- Logic layers: Deductive + Inductive reasoning
- Perception layers: Initial perception + pattern recognition
- Evaluation layers: Critical evaluation + alternative analysis
- Meta layer: Meta-analysis
- Synthesis layer: Consensus synthesis

#### Neural Parameters
- Adaptation rate: 0.15
- Exploration factor: 0.25
- Memory retention: 0.85
- Confidence threshold: 0.7
- Creativity boost: 0.2

#### Performance
- Startup time: < 500ms
- Question generation: ~50ms
- Extended thinking: ~200ms
- Evolution cycle: ~450ms (8x)
- Memory usage: ~5MB (50 patterns)
- LocalStorage: ~50KB per session

#### Security
- Client-side only operation
- No server communication
- No data transmission
- No API keys required
- No tracking or analytics
- LocalStorage only for data

### Design Decisions

#### Logic Prioritization
- Chose 75% logic weight as optimal balance
- Prevents other layers from outvoting reasoning
- Ensures logical consistency dominates
- Allows for some influence from other perspectives

#### 8x Architecture
- Best cost/benefit ratio
- 2 logic layers for thorough reasoning
- Sufficient diversity without overhead
- ~450ms execution time (production-ready)

#### Curriculum Learning
- 70% accuracy → Complexity Level 2
- 80% accuracy → Complexity Level 3
- 90% accuracy → Complexity Level 4
- Prevents frustration from overly difficult questions
- Ensures mastery before progression

#### LocalStorage
- Auto-save every 5 cycles
- Manual save/load buttons
- ~50KB storage per session
- No backend required
- Complete privacy

### Known Issues

None at release.

### Breaking Changes

None (initial release).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features

- Export/import agent profiles

- Multi-agent collaboration mode
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Offline PWA support
- WebAssembly acceleration for 16x/32x layers
- Multi-language support
- Voice interface option
- Accessibility improvements

### Under Consideration

- Cloud sync (opt-in)
- Collaborative learning
- Leaderboards (anonymous)
- Achievement system expansion
- Video tutorials
- Interactive onboarding
