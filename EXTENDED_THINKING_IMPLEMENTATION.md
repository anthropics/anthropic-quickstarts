## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Extended Thinking Tool (Python)
**File:** `agents/tools/extended_thinking.py`

Created a comprehensive extended thinking tool with:

✅ **6-Step Chain-of-Thought Process:**
- Step 1: Question Analysis (type identification, complexity estimation)
- Step 2: Key Concept Identification (domain-specific extraction)
- Step 3: Multi-Layer Analysis (4 specialized perspectives)
- Step 4: Strategy Selection (adaptive, weighted)
- Step 5: Option Evaluation (multi-strategy scoring)
- Step 6: Consensus Synthesis (confidence assessment)

✅ **4-Layer Architecture:**
- Layer 1: Perception (pattern recognition)
- Layer 2: Reasoning (logical inference)
- Layer 3: Evaluation (critical assessment)
- Layer 4: Meta-Learning (strategy optimization)

✅ **Features:**
- History tracking and pattern learning
- Confidence scoring with consensus
- Meta-analysis of reasoning quality
